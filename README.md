# Rule-Based Calculator (JavaScript)

This is a calculator project made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Instead of only focusing on the UI, this project mainly focuses on **handling inputs properly**
and controlling how the calculator reacts to different user actions.

I tried to build this like a real calculator where inputs follow rules,
not just random string additions.

## Features
- Basic operations: +, -, *, /
- Rule-based number and operator handling
- Decimal validation (prevents multiple decimals in one number)
- Clear and delete functionality
- Handles edge cases like trailing operators
- Extra `NA` button added only for layout symmetry

## What I learned from this project
- How to handle button-based inputs in JavaScript
- How to control invalid user input
- How to break logic into small functions
- Why input validation is important in real projects

## Tech Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

## Notes
- `eval()` is used for calculation (only for learning purpose)
- This project is not meant for production
- Main goal was to improve logic and thinking, not to build a perfect calculator
