# Calculator (JavaScript)

This is a simple calculator made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The main focus of this project is to handle inputs properly instead of just adding numbers blindly.
I tried to control wrong inputs like multiple operators, multiple decimals, etc.

## Features
- Basic operations: +, -, *, /
- Decimal handling
- Clear and delete buttons
- Prevents some invalid inputs
- Added NA button just for symmetry

## Why I made this
I made this project to practice JavaScript logic and understand how button inputs work in real projects.

## Tech Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Notes
- `eval()` is used to calculate the result.
- This project is for learning purpose.
